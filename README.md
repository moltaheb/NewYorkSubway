# MTA Analysis Part 3

This pair is a continuation of MTA Analysis Part 2. Answer the next few problems by building off of the [solutions 
notebook](../mta-pair-2/solution/mta-pair-2-solution.ipynb) for MTA Analysis Part 2.

#### Problem 7

We will plot the daily time series for a single turnstile.

In ipython notebook, add this to the beginning of your next cell:
```
    %matplotlib inline
```
This will make your matplotlib graphs integrate nicely with the
notebook. 

To plot the time series, import matplotlib with
```
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
- Select one turnstile (combination of [`C/A`, `UNIT`, `SCP`, `STATION`])
- Filter your pandas DataFrame so it only represents a single turnstile (make sure that turnstile has entries for multiple days).
- Using matplotlib, create a plot with the days on the X axis and the daily entries for that turnstile on the Y axis

You can use the following as a starting point:
```
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))
    plt.plot(<days>,<entries>)
```
#### Problem 8

Plot the daily time series for a station.

#### Problem 9

Make one list of counts for **one** week for one station. Monday's
count, Tuesday's count, etc. so it's a list of 7 counts.
Make the same list for another week, and another week, and another
week. (hint: [pandas datetime day of week](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.dayofweek.html#pandas.Series.dt.dayofweek) may be useful)

`plt.plot(week_count_list)` for every `week_count_list` you created
this way. You should get a rainbow plot of weekly commute numbers on
top of each other.


#### Problem 10

Make a single list of these total ridership values and plot it with

    plt.hist(total_ridership_counts)

to get an idea about the distribution of total ridership among
different stations.

This should show you that most stations have a small traffic, and the
histogram bins for large traffic volumes have small bars.

*Additional Hint*:

If you want to see which stations take the meat of the traffic, you
can sort the total ridership counts and make a `plt.bar` graph. For
this, you want to have two lists: the indices of each bar, and the
values. The indices can just be `0,1,2,3,...`, so you can do

    indices = range(len(total_ridership_values))
    plt.bar(indices, total_ridership_values)
