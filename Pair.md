#### Pair Problem

1. Send a request to the following site: https://www.amazon.in/gp/bestsellers/books/
2. Extract the Title, Author, Rating, Number of Reviews and Price for each book
3. Clean the rating, number of reviews and price (while also retaining raw uncleaned data)
4. Create a dictionary for each book and append to a list
5. Use the list to create a Pandas DataFrame and write the DataFrame to a parquet file
